## 🚀 How It Works: A Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Step 1: Provide Context**
    *   Navigate to the **Generator** page.
    *   Fill out the form with your initial thoughts: a problem you've noticed, a core idea, an industry of interest, or a target audience.
    *   **Crucially, provide a `Web Search Query`**. This is what the AI will use to research and validate the ideas (e.g., *"latest trends in AI developer tools"*).

2.  **Step 2: Generate & Analyze**
    *   Click the `Generate Ideas` button.
    *   The AI will process your input, perform a Google Search, and present two detailed `Idea Cards`.
    *   Dive deep into each card to analyze every aspect of the business concept.
    *   Scroll down to the **"Powered by Google Search"** section to review the exact web sources the AI used.

3.  **Step 3: Visualize Your Brand**
    *   On any idea card, click `Generate Logo` to create a visual identity.
    *   Not quite right? Click `Regenerate`, type in your preferences (e.g., *"more geometric, using green and black"*), and generate a new version.

4.  **Step 4: Save and Manage**
    *   Love an idea? Click the **Bookmark Icon** to save it.
    *   Navigate to the **Dashboard** page to view and manage all your saved ideas. Your generated logos are saved automatically with the idea.
